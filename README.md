## Introduction

Hi, we are in a robotics compition called FLL, and our team name is RobotMakers, and our names are Anika, Aidan, Ryan,Antoni, and Ariana. We all do FLL (First Lego League), and we all go to Noddin Elementry School, for anyone who does'nt know about FLL its a robotics compition. We code on Pybricks Beta which is like a python coding software, and in this repo we keep the code for the robot.

## Innovation

The innovation project is 75 percent out of 100 percent. Our innovation project is about helping blind people, or disabled people ski, and what we are going to build for this inovation project is ski goggles with sensors for blind people, that tell you to "Go Left", or "Go Right", and tell you that there is a cliff or a steep drop. We also made slides (here is the link to the slides) which tells you how we were able to do the innovation project, starting from reseaching organizations, and sending emails to the top five, to building things to help people with disabilitles.

## Core Values

Core Values are these six things, Discovery, Innovation, Impact, Inclusion, Teamwork, and Fun, and they are what you are suppose to do as a team, and it is very important show these Core values during the compition, and the menaing of these core values are here: Teamwork means we are stronger when we work together .For example,we help each other with coding, building and researching Discovery means we explore new skills and ideas. We explore new skills together like using devices on the computer Innovation means we use creativity and persistence to solve problems.We build robotics to solve problems like coding the robot. Impact means we apply what we learn to improve the world.We learn together to help the world with our ideas Inclusion means respect each other and embrace our differences.We respect each other's ideas for innovation projects. Fun means we enjoy and celebrate what we do! We have fun together coding, building and with the innovation project.
